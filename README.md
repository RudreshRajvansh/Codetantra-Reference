# 💻 CodeTantra Reference

Hello there! 👋
I’m sharing solutions to help fellow C learners using CodeTantra tackle programming challenges.

### 🚀 **First Commit** — *05/10/2025*  
...with many more to come!

I will upload the solution to all the problems in **ESSENTIALS**, **DESIRABLE**, and **ADVANCE** as I solve them.  
I have added comments for reference to the question and to help you understand my logic.

### ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

Completing a program brings joy, but it's important to earn that joy through effort.  
So I request you to try hard before checking the reference.  

As I mentioned, I have added comments using AI, so there may be some chances that some of the solutions were altered by it.  
If any such case comes to you, please mention it in issues.  

Moreover, I assure you that all solutions are based on **my own logic** — no AI assistance was used in solving them.  
I will also proofread the solutions as I get time.
